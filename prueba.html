									<h1>Our Solution</h1>
									<p>In this page we will look at the introduction to our solution, the uniqueness of our team, how it adresses our problem, the strategic goal of our proposal, the methodology we are planning on using, the implementation plan, the approximate cost and the considerations that need to be made for our proyect.</p>
								</header>
								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>Throughout the student life students encounter a lot of problems whether it is with studying, making homework or making a long project. What majorly causes problem on the development of the students is the lack of sleeping; nevertheless, students can get the eight hours of sleep but won’t wake up when the time is right. This later on causes students to stress early in the morning, which on the long run is a health problem.</p>
								<h2>Team</h2>
								<p>The main value of our team is that we are both excellent 3rd Semester students here at an excelling university, Tecnologico de Monterrey, but even though we are in the same major, we think very differently which helps us complement each other. Both of our member currently have a job, one of us has been working in this area for over 3 years and the other in the business area, which allows us to have different perspective and improve our project.</p>
								<h2>Problem</h2>
								<p>People, mainly students don’t wake up when their alarm goes off.</p>
								<h2>Strategic goal</h2>
								<p>Our target is mainly students; sure this strategic goal could be used with people that work a lot of hours per day. We want to offer students something that will assure them wake up at the time they should, in an easygoing and user friendly app.</p>
								<h2>Methodology</h2>
								<p>-	the problem<br>
-	Define our  client<br>
-	Design the program<br>
-	Design UI<br>
-	Get feedback from “beta” testers<br>
-	Compile everything

</p>
								<h2>Implementation plan</h2>
								<p>For our implementation plan, we have decided to launch an App in playstore and another one in appstore. As for advertisement, we may need a little bit at the beginning, but we expect our idea to be advertised by its own uniqueness and utility, in other words, from user to user. When it helps one person to wake up the  day of an exam, that person will tell other 5, and so on.</p>
								<h2>Cost</h2>
								<p>The price is on MXN Pesos.<br>

We investigated what would the price be with a company that develops software and we have the exact price. 

<br>-	Building the app: We’ve decided to build the app specifically for iOS. We think that the UI experience of app goes along the neat and beautiful look of iOS. Price: $12,000.00 MXN
<br>-	UI: The UI is something that we really care and looked forward, we as a team decided that the least amount of clicks the user has to do it will reflect the dedication that we put into it. Price: $8,000.00 MXN

	<br>For example, setting an alarm takes 1. Open app 2. Go to the Alarm Menu 3. Add 4. Set Hour and Minutes 5. Save Alarm

<br>-	Ads: The app won’t have In-App-Purchases nevertheless it will count with ads. Adding an sponsor will cost $1,000.00 MXN

<br>-	Log-In System: Even though we don’t have a “log-in” system implemented on the app the cost of this would be $0.00 MXN. This will reduce the cost and server sided for the app. 

<br>-	Language: The app will be on English. This adds a cost $0.00 MXN since we don’t need to add another configuration. 

<br>-	App Store: To be registered as developer we must pay a $99.00 U.S.D or $1,889.90 MXN  per year to upload the app and make changes when needed.

<br>-	Base Salary 2017 at Jalisco is of $34,955.00 MXN we have an ETA for the app of one month and a half, in total the cost would be $17,477.5 MXN x 3 = $157,297.5 MXN 
	<br>We will count with three different programmers. 

<br>-	Total Cost: $180,186.99 MXN Based on one month and a half

</p>
								<h2>Considerations</h2>
								<p>When both apps are up and running, we would only need to check for occasional bugs, and update it approximately every 2 months, to keep it always new and fresh.(manteninance)</p>
